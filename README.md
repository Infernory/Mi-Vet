# Mi-Vet
Mi-Vet is a Startup whose goal is to streamline equine veterinary care through modern technology on their platform. Mi-Vet is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains T-SQL, C#/.NET, and ReactJS code for the survey builder I created for the app.
